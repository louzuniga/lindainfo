                Linda was so much more than a daughter, mother, sister or
                friend; she was that rare exception of a person who truly cared
                about others and made life-altering impressions on those lucky
                enough to cross her path. Linda led by example working hard all
                of her life, mentoring children and showing compassion by
                volunteering and caring for animals. Linda will forever be in
                our hearts and if we are worthy she will live on through our
                future acts of kindness and love. Linda is an example for us all
                and a hard act to follow…

                Linda was born in Fort Dix, NJ in 1947. Growing up as the child
                of an active duty Infantry Officer in the United States Army,
                she lived in military installations in New Jersey, Turkey, North
                Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. She was a graduate of North
                Fulton High School in Atlanta, GA. As an adult she lived in
                Georgia and South Carolina and lived in Yellow Springs, OH for
                more than 30 years. Mrs. Romanyszyn worked for more than 30
                years as the school secretary in the Springfield City School
                District. During that time, she touched the lives of and was
                admired by thousands of students, parents, and teachers. "Mom
                placed no importance on power or money; her life was built
                around helping people," said her son Adrian Romanyszyn of Chula
                Vista, California. "She always had a sense of fairness and love
                that was remarkable," he said.

                Linda also worked her weekends during the same period for more
                than 20 years as a shelter attendant for the Green County Animal
                Control. "Mom was devoted to the love and proper care of animals
                of all kinds; she cared for and placed thousands of animals
                during her time there," said her daughter, Nicole Zuniga of
                Troutdale, Oregon.

              <br />
              <p>
                Linda raised two wonderful and successful children. "Mom always
                let us make our own choices and stood behind us when we
                sometimes didn't choose the right ones," said her son. "She
                quietly stood behind us through thick and thin," said her
                daughter. "We will miss her so much," they both said.
              </p>

                In addition to son Adrian Romanyszyn (Michelle Sites) and
                daughter Nicole Zuniga (Lourexel), Linda is survived by their
                father, Michael Romanyszyn of San Antonio, TX, brother and

                grandson Seth Romanyszyn of San Antonio, TX, nephews Spencer
                Coughlin of Knoxville, TN and Kevin Coughlin of Durango, CO, and
